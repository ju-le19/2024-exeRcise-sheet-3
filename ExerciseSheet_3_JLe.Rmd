## Exercise 1: Initializing git

### 1d)

Strengths:

-   Decentralization: allows easy collaboration, because every developer has a copy of repository

-   Branching/Merging: You can create branches for independent features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch. Later on you can merge back the branches into the main.

Weakness:

-   Large Files: e.g. Images, videos, ..., will slow down operations (cloning, pushing, pulling). Can be negated but have to be set up first.

-   Difficult for Beginners: Very overwhelming for beginners and might be used conservatively until one is more comfortable with it.
